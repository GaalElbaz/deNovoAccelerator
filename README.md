# VLSI Final Project at Technion

This directory contains files related to my final project at Technion in the field of VLSI. In this project, I implemented an algorithm using SystemVerilog (SV) and subsequently designed the chip. The project includes synthesis, timing reports, power analysis, area reports, and post-silicon verification.
